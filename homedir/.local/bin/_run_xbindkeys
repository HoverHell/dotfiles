echo "D: killall xbindkeys" >&6
killall xbindkeys

## NOTE: `-n` is needed so we can get its pid by backgrounding manually.
xbindkeys -n &
pid=$!

## XXXXXX: Doesn't really work; xbindkeys seems to spawn child
## process(es) with itself and exit, leaving the returned pid unused.
echo "D: new pid: $pid" >&6
echo "$pid" > "$pidfile"
